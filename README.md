Report Merge Utility

Overview
This Python script enables users to compare two report files, identify duplicate or repeated entries, and efficiently merge data by moving input values from one sheet to another. The goal is to streamline the process of combining reports, ensuring that redundant information is managed intelligently and only unique, relevant data is retained.

Features
Compare reports to detect overlapping or repeated records.

Identify and highlight duplicate entries across both reports.

Merge data by moving or copying input values from one sheet to another.

Automatically filter out or flag repeated information for a clean, concise final report.

User-friendly setup and clear output for easy workflow integration.

How It Works
Input: Provide two report files (Excel or CSV format).

Processing: The script compares both reports, identifies matching rows or entries, and determines which data should be merged.

Merging: Input values from one sheet are moved or copied to the other based on overlap and redundancy rules.

Output: A new, merged report file with combined and de-duplicated data.

Usage
Place your two report files in the project directory.

Update the script’s configuration (if needed) to specify file names and columns for comparison.

Run the script:

bash
python merge_reports.py
Review the output file for your merged, cleaned report.

Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

openpyxl (for Excel files)

Install dependencies with:

bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
Example
If you have two sales reports from different departments, this script will:

Compare both reports for repeated transactions.

Move unique sales data from one sheet to another.

Output a single, consolidated report with all unique sales entries.

Customization
Adjust the columns used for comparison by editing the script’s configuration section.

Modify merge logic as needed for your specific data structure or business rules.
